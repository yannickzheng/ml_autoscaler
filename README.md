# Adaptive Horizontal Scaling with Machine Learning

This project implements an intelligent autoscaling engine that enhances Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) by using machine-learning–based predictions instead of static threshold rules.
The system continuously analyzes real-time application metrics, learns workload behavior, and proactively adjusts the number of replicas to maintain performance, reduce costs, and improve system stability.
